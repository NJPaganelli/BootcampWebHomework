			<h4>About</h4>

			<p>The sewing machine was invented in 1846; the jacquard loom in 1801. The spinning wheel dates back to perhaps the year 500 while the sewing needle goes back at least 3,000 years. The core operations behind the fashion industry have gone largely unchanged for many centuries. Excepting the highest performance gear and the simplest machine cut goods, at some point a human is going to perform an operation using their hands to construct a piece of clothing. </p>
			
			<p>It is my belief that new fabrication technologies are poised to break the mold the industry has been stuck in for the last 80 years. Advances in materials, technology, and computerized fabrication can provide what consumers are increasingly demanding and what brands are struggling to deliver: individuality. The best dressed people today and in the next 10-20 years will be those who frame their wardrobes around their individuality, avoiding the main cultural movements in clothing. Advanced fabrication technologies could provide the consumer with fully customizable and perfectly made-to-measure clothing within the very near future.</p>
